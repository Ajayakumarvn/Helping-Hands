1. Introduction
Helping Hands is a charity website developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) that aims to connect organizers, sponsors, volunteers, and individuals in need. The platform provides a centralized space for individuals and organizations to donate funds, sponsor projects, volunteer their time, and seek assistance. Its primary goal is to make a positive impact on society and offer a helping hand to those in need.

2. Technologies Used
The following technologies were utilized in the development of Helping Hands:

Frontend:

React.js: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
HTML/CSS: Markup language for structuring web pages and styling.
Bootstrap: CSS framework for responsive and mobile-first web development.
Backend:

Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment for executing server-side code.
Express.js: A web application framework for building RESTful APIs.
MongoDB: A NoSQL document database for storing data.
Additional Tools:

Mongoose: An object modeling tool for MongoDB.
Axios: A library for making HTTP requests from Node.js and the browser.


3. System Architecture
Helping Hands adopts a client-server architecture, where the frontend and backend are decoupled. The frontend handles user interactions and rendering the user interface, while the backend manages data storage, business logic, and API endpoints.

The frontend is built using React.js and communicates with the backend through HTTP requests to the RESTful API endpoints provided by the Express.js server. The server interacts with the MongoDB database using Mongoose to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the data.
